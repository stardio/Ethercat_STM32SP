# STM32H7S78-DK_24bpp TBS

Performance testing can be done using the GPIO pins designated with the following signals in CN10 connector on the underside of the board:

- VSYNC_FREQ  - CN14-D2 (PF1)
- RENDER_TIME - CN14-D4 (PF2)
- FRAME_RATE  - CN14-D7 (PF3)
- MCU_ACTIVE  - CN15-D8 (PF4)

## Debugging in STM32CubeIDE
Debugging the code in an IDE can be complex because of the Bootloader and Application structure of the TBS for STM32H7S78-DK. To step through the code of the TouchGFX application in STM32CubeIDE, follow these steps:
1. Generate code in TouchGFX Designer
2. Open the project in STM32CubeIDE
3. Launch a debug session for the Boot project
4. Wait for the compilation and flashing to complete
5. Terminate the debug session (Ctrl + F2)
6. Launch a debug session for the Appli project
7. Wait for the compilation and flashing to complete
8. Click Resume (F8)
9. Press the black NRST button on the STM32H7S7-DK board
10. The application is now at a break point at the first line of main() in the Appli project. If not, click Resume (F8) once more
11. Proceed by e.g. clicking Resume (F8) or Step Over (F6)
